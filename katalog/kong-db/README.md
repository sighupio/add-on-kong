# Kong DB architecture

In this architecture, Kong Ingress Controller is deployed as sidecar with Kong Proxy.

Only one Ingress Controller at a time is
the master, meaning that only one Ingress controller interacts with kong admin apis. All the configurations are written
by kong in the DB and all the other Kong Proxy will read the configurations from the DB.

This is a turnkey solution, you can eventually change some configurations like the service that is exposing the
kong ingress in the cluster and some fine-tuning in the kong gateway. You can also put the statefulset we bundle in the
deployment at 0 and change the addresses of your database of choice.
