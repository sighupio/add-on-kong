# Kong Add-on Module Release 3.0.0

Welcome to the latest release of the `kong` add-on module for [`Kubernetes Fury
Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team
SIGHUP.

This is a major release with the goal to update Kong images and kong ingress controllers to the latest version available.
Also the repository structure has been refactored and the Kong proxy pods are now Deployments, to align to upstream.

## Breaking changes

- The proxy component (data-plane) is now a Deployment with a default podAntiAffinity -> preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution. The DaemonSet has been removed, see Update guides.
- Repository structure has been refactored, now all the packages are inside the folder `katalog` instead of `katalog/kong`.

## Changes

- Developer portal svc is now pointed to the control plane.

## Update Guide for db-less deployment options ü¶Æ from module version 2.8.1 to 3.0.0

To update your Kong cluster to the latest version, you need to apply the new version using for example:

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path> | kubectl apply -f -
```

> Note: Remember to patch the number of replicas of the ingress-kong deployment with the desired number.

Wait the new version to be up and running and delete the old deprecated resources with:

```bash
kubectl -n kong delete 
```

## Update Guide for db deployment options ü¶ç from module version 2.8.1 to 3.0.0

To update your kong cluster to the latest version you need to follow the following upgrade procedure, there will be some
downtime while the new version is deployed:

Delete the existing job using:

```bash
kubectl -n kong delete job kong-migrations
```

Then **patch** the migration with the `migrations up` command:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kong-migrations
  namespace: kong
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kong-migrations
          command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "kong migrations up" ]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the new updated manifests and wait for the job to complete.

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path> | kubectl apply -f -
```

> Note: Remember to patch the number of replicas of the ingress-kong Deployment with the desired number.

Then delete the old kong-migrations job:

```bash
kubectl -n kong delete job kong-migrations
```

Now **patch** the migration with the `migrations finish` command:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kong-migrations
  namespace: kong
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kong-migrations
          command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "kong migrations finish" ]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the new updated manifests and wait for the job to complete. All the Kong pods now should be running with the latest version.

```bash
kustomize build <your-project-path> | kubectl apply -f -
```

Wait the new version to be up and running and delete the old deprecated resources with: 

```bash
kubectl -n kong delete daemonset ingress-kong-dp
```
