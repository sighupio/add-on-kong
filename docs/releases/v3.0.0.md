## Update Guide for db deployment options ü¶ç

To update your kong cluster to the latest version you need to follow the following upgrade procedure, there will be some
downtime while the new version is deployed:

Delete the existing job using:

```bash
kubectl delete job kong-migrations
```

Then **patch** the migration with the `migrations up` command:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kong-migrations
  namespace: kong
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kong-migrations
          command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "kong migrations up" ]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the new updated manifests and wait for the job to complete.

Then delete the old kong-migrations job:

```bash
kubectl delete job kong-migrations
```

Now **patch** the migration with the `migrations finish` command:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: kong-migrations
  namespace: kong
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kong-migrations
          command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "kong migrations finish" ]
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

Apply the new updated manifests and wait for the job to complete. All the Kong pods now should be running with the latest version.
